# Development Setup:

1. Install Node.js and whatever text editor you plan on using (VS Code the wave, just saying).
2. Clone the repository (use Github Desktop if you're not comfortable with the git CLA).
3. Open terminal in the "Competitions-WebApp" directory and run "npm install."
4. "npm run dev" starts the development server.
