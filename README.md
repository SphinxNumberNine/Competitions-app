# Development Setup:

1. Install Node.js and whatever text editor you plan on using (VS Code the wave, just saying).
2. Clone the repository (use Github Desktop if you're not comfortable with the git CLA).
3. Open terminal in the "Competitions-WebApp" directory and run "npm install."
4. "npm run dev" starts the development server.

# Goals / Timechecks

1. November 1st: Backend of the application fully completed (barring small tweaks)
2. December 1st: Functionality of the application completed (with everything still looking vanilla, without proper styling or design)
3. December 20th: Full site completed, including design, pictures, etc (depending on specifications of NJNS admins).
4. January 1st: Site launch.

# Functionality

* The site is designed to be an application where users can sign up for NJNS competitions, and once they are signed up, recieve emails specific to them about their competition.

* Each student will have their own login, and will have their own dashboard
* Each student's dashboard will contain their competition group, time, and any other information related to it.
* Each parent will also have their own login, and will have their own dashboard
* Each parent's dashboard will have information about all of their children registered in competitions, as well as logistical information and financial information.
